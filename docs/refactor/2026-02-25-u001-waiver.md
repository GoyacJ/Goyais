# U-001 Waiver Record

- Date: 2026-02-25
- Unknown ID: U-001
- Topic: Runtime parity beyond wrapper bootstrap (`--print` / interactive / full help matrix) against original `Kode-cli` runtime payload.

## Context

- T-001 captured wrapper-level parity evidence in `docs/refactor/parity/kode-cli-wrapper-golden.json`.
- Full runtime parity matrix depended on in-repo reproducible `Kode-cli/dist` payload and runtime tree.
- T-007 one-shot cutover removed in-repo `Kode-cli` runtime dependency path and switched delivery baseline to Hub-only runtime stack.

## Waiver Decision

- Decision: **Waived for release acceptance**.
- Approval basis: user approved continuing with global acceptance after T-007 (`可以`, 2026-02-25, in-thread).

## Risk Note

- Historical full-matrix runtime parity with removed `Kode-cli` payload is no longer executable in this repo state.
- Ongoing behavior baseline is now maintained via Hub/Desktop tests and run-centric contracts.
